//Module solution

//pseudocode for:
/*You'll need two higher-level variables to track the value that is 
currently appearing the most 
and how many times it is appearing. */

  // create the variable for most appearing value 
  // create variable for most appearing count

  //pseudocode for:
  /*You'll need to compare every item in the arry to every other item 
  and count how many times they match*/

  // loop over array (i)
  //start a counter for number of occurences

  // loop over array again (j)
  //compare indexes
  // if same, increase counter

  // if counter > current most appearing count
  // update "most" variables to match

  // return most appearing value and count

  //array
  const numbers = [41, 24, 1, 40, 41, 32, 33, 50, 5, 34, 50, 5, 34, 5, 21, 21, 43, 43, 4, 49, 24];

  // create the variable for most appearing value 
  const mostDuplicates = (arr) => {

  };

  console.log(mostDuplicates(numbers));
  // prints the numbers that occur most often in the array
